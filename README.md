# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Diabetes

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for diabetes involves several key steps to understand and prepare the dataset for further analysis. It begins with data collection, where features like age, BMI, glucose levels, and diabetes diagnosis are gathered. The data is then cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inaccuracies. Descriptive statistics are calculated to understand the basic properties of the data. Visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps help reveal distributions, outliers, and correlations. Feature engineering may be applied to enhance the dataset, and statistical tests assess the significance of relationships between variables. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can be used to simplify the dataset while preserving essential information. If the data is imbalanced, methods such as oversampling or SMOTE are employed. Finally, the findings are summarized to highlight key insights and inform further steps. This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough understanding of the diabetes dataset, facilitating effective analysis and modeling.
